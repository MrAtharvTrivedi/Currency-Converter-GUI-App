Hey Folks!

This Currency Converter GUI App is built with the help of Python, and three well know Python libraries; "Requests", "Customtkinter" and "Beautiful Soup"

To run this app on your PC or Laptop you will need to install both the libraries used for building the application.

To install the libraries:

Open Terminal or Windows Powershell 
Type "pip install customtkinter" and hit enter, and it will automatically install the Library for you.
After customtkinter is installed, repeat the process for the remaining two libraries but this time replace "customtkinter" with "requests" and "beautifulsoup".
